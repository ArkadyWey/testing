    "    Start by writing a test that defines a specific piece of functionality or behavior.\n",
    "    The test initially fails since the corresponding code doesn't exist.\n",
    "    Write the Minimum Code to Pass the Test:\n",

    "    Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the newly created test pass.\n",
    "    This step focuses on meeting the immediate requirements of the test, not on writing a complete solution.\n",

    "2. Run the Tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Execute all the tests in the test suite to ensure that the new code didn't break existing functionality.\n",
    "    If any test fails, make adjustments to the code to fix the issues.\n",

    "3. Refactor Code (Optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "    Refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, or efficiency while ensuring that all tests continue to pass.\n",
    "    Refactoring is optional but can be performed without fear of introducing errors due to the safety net of existing tests.\n",

    "    Repeat the process by writing another test for the next piece of functionality or refining existing tests.\n",
